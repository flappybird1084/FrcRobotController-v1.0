    Requests Motion Magic® to target a final position using a motion profile, and
    PID to a differential position setpoint.
    
    Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to honor
    the Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk value specified via the Motion
    Magic® configuration values.  This control mode does not use the Expo_kV or
    Expo_kA configs.  Target position can be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic®
    will do its best to adjust the profile.  This control mode is voltage-based, so
    relevant closed-loop gains will use Volts for the numerator.

                          FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque
                          (current) control.  However, this may be inconvenient for
                          applications that require specifying duty cycle or
