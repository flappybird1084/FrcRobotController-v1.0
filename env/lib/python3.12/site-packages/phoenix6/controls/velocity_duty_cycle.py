    Request PID to target velocity with duty cycle feedforward.
    
    This control mode will set the motor's velocity setpoint to the velocity

                          FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque
                          (current) control.  However, this may be inconvenient for
                          applications that require specifying duty cycle or
                          voltage.  CTR-Electronics has developed a hybrid method

                          allowing applications to provide duty cycle or voltage
                          demand.  This not to be confused with simple sinusoidal
