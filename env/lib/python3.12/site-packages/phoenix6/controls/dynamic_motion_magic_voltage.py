class DynamicMotionMagicVoltage:

    Requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore;
    Requests Motion Magic® to target a final position using a motion profile.  This
    dynamic request allows runtime changes to Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and
    Jerk.  Users can optionally provide a voltage feedforward.  This control
    requires use of a CANivore.
    
    Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to honor
    the specified Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk value.  This control mode
    does not use the Expo_kV or Expo_kA configs.  Target position can be changed
    on-the-fly and Motion Magic® will do its best to adjust the profile.  This
    control mode is voltage-based, so relevant closed-loop gains will use Volts for
    the numerator.

                          FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque
