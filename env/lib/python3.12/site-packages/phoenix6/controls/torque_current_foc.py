class TorqueCurrentFOC:
    """
    Requires Phoenix Pro;
    Request a specified motor current (field oriented control).
    
    This control request will drive the motor to the requested motor (stator)
    current value.  This leverages field oriented control (FOC), which means greater
    peak power than what is documented.  This scales to torque based on Motor's kT
    constant.
    
    :param output:    Amount of motor current in Amperes
    :type output: ampere
    :param max_abs_duty_cycle:    The maximum absolute motor output that can be
                                  applied, which effectively limits the velocity.
                                  For example, 0.50 means no more than 50% output in
                                  either direction.  This is useful for preventing
                                  the motor from spinning to its terminal velocity
                                  when there is no external torque applied unto the
                                  rotor.  Note this is absolute maximum, so the
                                  value should be between zero and one.
    :type max_abs_duty_cycle: float
    :param deadband:    Deadband in Amperes.  If torque request is within deadband,
                        the bridge output is neutral. If deadband is set to zero
                        then there is effectively no deadband. Note if deadband is
                        zero, a free spinning motor will spin for quite a while as
                        the firmware attempts to hold the motor's bemf. If user
                        expects motor to cease spinning quickly with a demand of
                        zero, we recommend a deadband of one Ampere. This value will
                        be converted to an integral value of amps.
    :type deadband: ampere

                                          is zero (or within deadband).  Set to
                                          false to use the NeutralMode configuration
                                          setting (default). This flag exists to
                                          provide the fundamental behavior of this
                                          control when output is zero, which is to
                                          provide 0A (zero torque).
    :type override_coast_dur_neutral: bool
    :param limit_forward_motion:    Set to true to force forward limiting.  This
                                    allows users to use other limit switch sensors
                                    connected to robot controller.  This also allows
                                    use of active sensors that require external
