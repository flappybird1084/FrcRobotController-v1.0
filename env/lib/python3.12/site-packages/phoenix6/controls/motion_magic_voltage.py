class MotionMagicVoltage:
    """
    Requests Motion Magic® to target a final position using a motion profile.  Users
    can optionally provide a voltage feedforward.
    
    Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to honor
    the Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk value specified via the Motion
    Magic® configuration values.  This control mode does not use the Expo_kV or
    Expo_kA configs.  Target position can be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic®
    will do its best to adjust the profile.  This control mode is voltage-based, so
    relevant closed-loop gains will use Volts for the numerator.

                          FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque
                          (current) control.  However, this may be inconvenient for

                          voltage.  CTR-Electronics has developed a hybrid method
                          that combines the performances gains of FOC while still
                          allowing applications to provide duty cycle or voltage
