        The Pigeon2 integrates this to calculate the true reported yaw.

        When using the WPI Sim GUI, you will notice a readonly yaw and settable rawYawInput.
        The readonly signal is the emulated yaw which will match self-test in Tuner and the hardware API.
        Changes to rawYawInput will be integrated into the emulated yaw.
        This way a simulator can modify the yaw without overriding hardware API calls for home-ing the sensor.
