class SignalLogger:
    """
    Static class for controlling the Phoenix 6 signal logger.

    This logs all the signals from the CAN buses into .hoot files.
    Each file name starts with the CANivore serial number or "rio"
    for the roboRIO CAN bus, followed by the timestamp. In the
    header of a hoot file, the CANivore name and firmware version
    are logged in plain text.

    During an FRC match, the log file will be renamed to include the
    event name, match type, and match number at the start of the file
    name. The match type will be 'P' for practice matches, 'Q' for
    qualification matches, and 'E' for elimination matches.
