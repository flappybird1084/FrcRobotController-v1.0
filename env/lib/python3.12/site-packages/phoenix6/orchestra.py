class Orchestra:
    """
    Orchestra is used to play music through devices. It uses a "Chirp" (.chrp) music
    file that can be generated using Phoenix Tuner. Chirp files are generated from
    standard MIDI files.

    Any Chirp file located in the src/main/deploy directory of your FRC project will
    automatically be copied to the roboRIO on code deploy.

    The robot must be enabled to play music. Additionally, devices playing in Orchestra
    will not run any other control requests while Orchestra is running. Users can
    :ref:pause: or :ref:stop: the Orchestra to re-enable device control.

    Each device can only play a single track within the music file. For multi-track
    files, multiple devices are needed. Devices can be added with an explicit track
    number. Otherwise, the first track will be played through the first Talon FX added,
    the second track will be played through the second Talon FX added, etc.

    To use Orchestra:

    - Add the Talon FXs to be used as instruments using :ref:add_instrument:.
    - Load the Chirp file to be played using :ref:load_music:. This can also
    be done in the Orchestra constructor.

    Both of these can also be done in the Orchestra constructor.

    Once ready, the Orchestra can be controlled using :ref:play:/:ref:pause:/:ref:stop:.
    New music files can be loaded at any time.
